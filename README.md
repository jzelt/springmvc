SpringMVC-Template contains an Eclipse project that can be used as a starting
point for creating a new Eclipse-based, Maven-managed Spring MVC project.

This project was initially created from the "Spring MVC Project" template
provided by the Spring Tool Suite (STS) for Eclipse Kepler (4.3). I customized
that project further to provide the functionality closer to what I wanted as a
starting point for new Spring MVC projects. So far, I have implemented the 
following changes:

    1. XML --> Javaconfig
    2. log4j --> logback
